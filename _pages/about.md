I am a PhD student at the University of Duisburg-Essen and the Research Training Group Regional Disparities and Economic Policy. 

My primary research interests are in labor and urban economics. Currently, I study heterogeneity in wage growth across local labor markets.

I received a master's in economics in 2020 from the Paris School of Economics, and a master's in economics in 2019 from the University of Mannheim. I obtained my bachelor's in economics from the Lancaster University.
