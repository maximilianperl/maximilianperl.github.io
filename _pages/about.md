I am a PhD student in economics at the University of Duisburg-Essen and at the [Doctoral Research Training Group Regional Disparities & Economic Policy](https://www.regional-disparities.de).
My research interests are urban and labor economics. In my current work, I study the causes of regional disparities in life-cycle wage growth.

I received a master's in economics in 2020 from the Paris School of Economics, and a master's in economics in 2019 from the University of Mannheim. I obtained my bachelor's in economics from Lancaster University.
