I am a PhD student at the University of Duisburg-Essen and the Research Training Group Regional Disparities and Economic Policy. 

My primary research interests are in labor and urban economics, focusing on heterogeneity in wage growth across local labor markets.

I received a master's in economics in 2020 from the Paris School of Economics, and a master's in economics in 2019 from the University of Mannheim. I obtained a bachelor's in economics from the Lancaster University.
