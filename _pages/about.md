Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in economics at the University of Duisburg-Essen and the [Doctoral Research Training Group on Regional Disparities & Economic Policy](https://www.regional-disparities.de).

My research interests are urban and regional economics. In my current work, I study earnings disparities across cities in Germany and place-based policies in South Korea.

I graduated with master's in economics from the Paris School of Economics and from the University of Mannheim. I obtained my bachelor's in economics from Lancaster University.
