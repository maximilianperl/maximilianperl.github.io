I am a PhD student in economics at the University of Duisburg-Essen and at the Research Training Group Regional Disparities & Economic Policy. 

My primary research interests are in labor and urban economics. In my current work I study the heterogeneity in wage growth across local labor markets. I have also worked on the political consequences of the Spanish Flu.

I received a master's in economics in 2020 from the Paris School of Economics, and a master's in economics in 2019 from the University of Mannheim. I obtained my bachelor's in economics from Lancaster University.
